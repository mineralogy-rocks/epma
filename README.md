### Parsing and uploading EPMA data for mineralogy-rocks API

---

This is the Erebus library developed to perform mineral classification, missing value imputation,
validation and upload of EPMA data into mineralogy-rocks data storage.

The models have been developed at the [Comenius University](https://uniba.sk/en/), with the data of
Prof Marián Putiš research team at the [Department of Mineralogy, Petrology and Economic Geology](https://kmplg.sk/?lang=en) of 
[Faculty of Natural Sciences](https://fns.uniba.sk/en/).

The project received funding from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation 
Programme on the basis of a grant agreement under the Marie Skłodowska-Curie scheme No. 945478 
and was supported by the Slovak Research and Development Agency (contract APVV-19-0065).
